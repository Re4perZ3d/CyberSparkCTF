## Solution Walkthrough

### üîç Step 1: Check the Metadata

Start by examining the metadata of the provided image using `exiftool`:

Among the usual metadata, you'll notice a comment:

```
Comment        : passphrase= graya3_yheb_lasagne
```

This is a strong hint that **Steghide** was used to embed data, and the provided phrase is the **passphrase**.

### üóÇÔ∏è Step 2: Extract the Hidden File with Steghide

Use `steghide` to extract hidden data from the image using the discovered passphrase:

```bash
steghide extract -sf image.jpg
```

### üß© Step 3: Fix the Corrupted JPEG Header

The extracted image is corrupted due to a **damaged JPEG header**. To fix this:

Steps:

1. Open `corrupted.jpg` in a **hex editor** (e.g., `HxD`, `hexeditor`, `imhex`, or the online tool [hexed.it](https://hexed.it)).
2. Compare it with a valid JPEG header (e.g., from another working JPEG):

3. Replace the incorrect header bytes with a valid JPEG header.

A typical JPEG file begins with:

```
FF D8 FF E0 ...
