## Challenge Description

This challenge is part of a beginner-level Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) CTF. It focuses on analyzing a real-world APT campaign named **ArcaneDoor**, leveraging the MITRE ATT&CK framework, CVE databases, and threat actor profiling. Participants are expected to identify key TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures), malicious software, and exploited vulnerabilities.
